DA102.3 Project: Deforestation Exploration
3 hours remaining

Introduction
You’re a data analyst for ForestQuery, a non-profit organization, on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and which raises awareness about this important environmental topic.

Your executive director and her leadership team members are looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size,
and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications,
and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.

You’ve been able to find tables of data online dealing with forestation as well as total land area and region groupings, and you’ve brought these tables together into a database that you’d like to query to answer
some of the most important questions in preparation for a meeting with the ForestQuery executive team coming up in a few days. Ahead of the meeting, you’d like to prepare and disseminate a report for the leadership team
that uses complete sentences to help them understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.

Steps to Complete
CREATE VIEW forestation 
AS
SELECT f.country_code,
        r.region,
        r.income_group,
        f.country_name, 
        f.year, 
        f.forest_area_sqkm,
		l.total_area_sq_mi, 
        l.total_area_sq_mi*2.59 AS tot_area_sqkm
FROM forest_area f
      JOIN land_area l
      ON f.country_code = l.country_code 
      AND f.year = l.year
      JOIN regions r
      ON l.country_code = r.country_code

The forest_area and land_area tables join on both country_code AND year.
The regions table joins these based on only country_code.
In the ‘forestation’ View, include the following:

All of the columns of the origin tables
A new column that provides the percent of the land area that is designated as forest.
Keep in mind that the column forest_area_sqkm in the forest_area table and the land_area_sqmi in the land_area table are in different units (square kilometers and square miles, respectively),
so an adjustment will need to be made in the calculation you write (1 sq mi = 2.59 sq km).


Instructions
You will be creating a report for the executive team in which you explain your results using complete sentences.

Report Sections
The report has five sections that you will need to complete:

1. Global Situation
2. Regional Outlook
3. Country-Level Detail
4. Recommendations
5. Appendix: SQL queries used
You'll find further details on what you should complete for these sections on the next few pages.

Project Starter Template

Project Rubric
When you submit your project, we'll give it a thorough review and provide you with feedback on what you did well and anything that needs to be improved. To see the exact criteria that your reviewer will use to check your work, you can look over the project rubric.

1. GLOBAL SITUATION
Instructions:

Answering these questions will help you add information into the template.
Use these questions as guides to write SQL queries.
Use the output from the query to answer these questions.
a. What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 1990? Please keep in mind that you can use the country record denoted as “World" in the region table.
SELECT  country_name, year, forest_area_sqkm
FROM    forestation
WHERE   country_name = 'World' AND year = '1990'

b. What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 2016? Please keep in mind that you can use the country record in the table is denoted as “World.”
SELECT forest_area_sqkm
FROM forestation
WHERE country_name = 'World' AND year = '2016'

c. What was the change (in sq km) in the forest area of the world from 1990 to 2016?
SELECT t1.forest_area_sqkm - t2.forest_area_sqkm AS change_in_sqkm
FROM
(SELECT  country_name, year, forest_area_sqkm
FROM    forestation
WHERE   country_name = 'World' AND year = '1990') t1
JOIN
(SELECT country_name, year, forest_area_sqkm
FROM forestation
WHERE country_name = 'World' AND year = '2016') t2
ON
t1.country_name= t2.country_name

d. What was the percent change in forest area of the world between 1990 and 2016?
SELECT (t1.forest_area_sqkm - t2.forest_area_sqkm)/(t1.forest_area_sqkm)*100 AS percentage_change
FROM
(SELECT  country_name, year, forest_area_sqkm
FROM    forestation
WHERE   country_name = 'World' AND year = '1990') t1
JOIN
(SELECT country_name, year, forest_area_sqkm
FROM forestation
WHERE country_name = 'World' AND year = '2016') t2
ON
t1.country_name= t2.country_name

e. If you compare the amount of forest area lost between 1990 and 2016, to which country's total area in 2016 is it closest to?
    SELECT l.country_name,
       l.total_area_sq_mi*2.59 AS total_area_sqkm,
       ABS((l.total_area_sq_mi*2.59)- (SELECT t1.forest_area_sqkm - t2.forest_area_sqkm AS diff_forest_area_sq_km
